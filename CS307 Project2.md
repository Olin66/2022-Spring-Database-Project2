The directory src.main.java contains the code of our server, src.main.resources contains the original data,  *xml of spring mappers, our sql tables, and the front client code. The directory src.test contains unit test functions.

All the APIs are in the directory src.main.java.com.cs307.projct.service, they will be introduced in the next parts.
